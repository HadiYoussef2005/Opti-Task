# Opti-Task

### What Opti-Task Does
Opti-Task allows you to add items with event lengths and priorities by user. It will store the information for each user, and require each user to login both with their own Opti-Task account and a Google account. Users can then list events they need to attend, or general items they need done by a specific date and specify event length and priority. It will then sort items to display by priority and by how close the due date is. There is an option to add your events to your calendar as well, which will allow you to add all these events with their lengths to your Google Calendar
